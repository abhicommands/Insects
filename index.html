                <p>The first warm evening of spring brought more than just the scent of blooming forsythia — it brought
                    mosquitoes. I felt that familiar sting on my ankle before I even saw it. When I finally spotted the
                    tiny, almost weightless body hovering near my calf, I remembered how much this insect — seemingly
                    insignificant — has shaped human history.</p>

                <p>As I sat still, I watched it land, its needle-like proboscis piercing my skin with surgical
                    precision. It fed quickly and silently, leaving only a slight itch behind. A pest, sure — but an
                    incredibly efficient one. The female, in need of a protein-rich blood meal to lay eggs, shows a kind
                    of ruthless evolutionary drive I can’t help but admire.</p>

                <p>Mosquitoes have always hovered at the edge of my life. One of my relatives in Nepal — my mom's cousin
                    — caught dengue during a bad outbreak in Kathmandu a few summers ago. It was a scary time. Everyone
                    in their neighborhood was covering up water containers, burning coils, and checking windows
                    obsessively. He recovered, but barely — his platelet count had dropped dangerously low. Since then,
                    every mosquito buzz feels a little more ominous.</p>

                <p>It’s strange — for such tiny creatures, they leave a big psychological imprint. As a kid, I’d lie
                    awake listening to their high-pitched whines, too scared to move. My grandma used to say if you hear
                    one, it’s already too late.</p>

                <p>Now, as someone who studies insects, I’m trying to reframe how I see mosquitoes. Yes, they’re vectors
                    of disease, but they’re also marvels of adaptation — drawn to CO₂, body heat, and sweat. The one I
                    saw tonight probably hatched from a puddle near the gutter, ready to continue a cycle that’s lasted
                    millions of years.</p>

                <p>I wonder if we’ll ever really beat them — or if we’ll just keep learning to live around them.</p>
